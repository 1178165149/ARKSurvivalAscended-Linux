# Tools for managing ARK Survival Ascended on Linux

## Installation on Debian 12

To install ARK Survival Ascended Dedicated Server on Debian 12,
download and run [server-install-debian12.sh](server-install-debian12.sh)
as root or sudo.

Quick run (if you trust me, which you of course should not):

```bash
sudo su -c "bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdp1337/ARKSurvivalAscended-Linux/main/server-install-debian12.sh)" root
```
